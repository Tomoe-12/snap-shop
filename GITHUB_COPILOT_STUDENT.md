3. Upload a clearer, more recent document
4. Contact your school's IT department to confirm your email domain
5. Contact [GitHub Education Support](https://support.github.com/contact/education)

### School Email Not Recognized

If your school email isn't recognized:
1. Ensure your email domain is correct
2. Try using document upload instead
3. Contact GitHub Education Support to add your institution
4. Ask your school to register with GitHub Education

### Verification Email Not Received

1. Check your spam/junk folder
2. Ensure the email address is correctly added to your GitHub account
3. Resend the verification email from GitHub settings
4. Wait 10-15 minutes for delivery

### Already Graduated or About to Graduate

- Access continues until your stated graduation date
- You can reapply if continuing education (grad school, etc.)
